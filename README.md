# MachineLearningMEIC

## Project Overview

This project explores machine learning techniques applied to sports analytics. Over the past 10 years, comprehensive data has been collected on players, teams, coaches, games, and various performance metrics. The objective is to leverage this dataset to make predictions for the upcoming test season.

## Objectives

In the upcoming season, our goals are to develop predictive models for:

- **Regular Season Rankings:** Estimate the final standings for each conference based on historical and current season data.
- **Coaching Changes:** Identify teams with a high probability of changing coaches, using trends and performance indicators.
- **Individual Awards:** Forecast recipients of major individual awards by analyzing player statistics and performance metrics.

These objectives will guide our analysis and model development throughout the project.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Player statistics
- Team performance metrics
- Coaching history
- Game results
- Award recipients
