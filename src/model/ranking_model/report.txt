Explanation:
- The model predicts each team's expected win percentage for a season.
- Rankings are derived by sorting teams by predicted win percentage.
- Spearman correlation measures how well predicted rankings match actual ones.
- The model currently uses team-based features only (no coach/player inputs).
- It is ready for future expansion to include coach performance or player stats.
